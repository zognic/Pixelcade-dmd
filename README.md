# Pinball Table DMD Image Set

## Overview

This repository contains a set of Dynamic Marquee Display (DMD) images or Marquees for various pinball tables, specifically designed for display on the [Pixelcade](https://pixelcade.org/) or ZeDMD 
device while navigating through tables in EmulationStation.

## Description

The images follow a naming convention based on the table's name, including the manufacturer and year of release. The purpose of this collection is to enhance the visual experience for users navigating pinball tables within the EmulationStation frontend, creating a visually appealing and organized representation of each table.

## Table Naming Convention

The naming convention for the images follows the format: \`table_name (Manufacturer Year)\`. This standardized naming approach helps users quickly identify and associate the DMD images with specific pinball tables.

## Contribution

Contributions to expand and improve this image set are welcome. If you have DMD images for additional pinball tables, feel free to contribute by following the established naming convention.

Regarding your creation, Pixelcade has **128×32** or 4,096 total LEDs for 2 panels or 64×32 or 2,048 LEDs for 1 panel, each LED = 1 pixel. If your animation is a higher resolution, that’s ok too, Pixelcade will automatically re-size it. Just keep in mind a high resolution image isn’t going to look good. Use the same frame rate for each frame in your GIF, Pixelcade will not play different frames at different speeds and will rather use the frame rate of the second frame in your GIF for all frames. If creating a still image, then export in .PNG format.



Happy pinball gaming!
